            The idea of Oracle came from the name of our group, Deus Ex Machina, or "God from the machine".
            Oracles purpose is to predict the future of climate change.
            There are a few reasons why this is very difficult.
            One being the massive irregularity of climate data due to an immeasureable number of variables,
            one example being the period between 1940 and 1945, during which World War II occurred.
            After many, many failed attempts, Facebook's Prophet algorithm was highly successful and accurate,
            resulting in it being the algorithm that was used to model Oracle.
